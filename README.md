<h5>About</h5>
<p>This is a Solana program written in Rust to do some basic bioinformatics functionality. My inspiration for this project is from 
  <a href='https://rosalind.info' >Project Rosalind</a>. This program has 4 instructions. The first three instructions can take a string representing
  nucleotide base and then transcribe it from DNA to RNA, or detranscribe it from RNA to DNA or complement it. The fourth instruction creates a Program Derived Account (PDA)
  and store it inside.
